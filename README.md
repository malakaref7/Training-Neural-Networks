# Training-Neural-Networks
In this assignment, will build a neural network from scratch using PyTorch and train it on
the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
We will also add dropout and regularization layers to improve the modelâ€™s performance. Finally, will hyper-tune the optimizer type, learning rate, and batch size to achieve the best
possible results.
